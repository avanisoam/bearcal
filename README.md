# BearCal

## Description
*BearCal* is a jQuery Widget Factory plugin that produces an interactive calendar.

## So what? There are a ton of these?
Yes, too right, but this one is a bit different.

* Half-day tracking functionality (AM/PM)
* Interactive date range selection
* Next/Prev slide animation to view more months
* And more... I just don't feel like writting it all out just yet  

## Customize
*BearCal* has many configurable options and relies heavily on CSS for styling and interaction

Still need to fill this out too

## Usage
Create a DOM element to attach the plugin to:
    
    <div class="bearcal"></div>

Attach the plugin:
    
    $('.bearcal').BearCal();
